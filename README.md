Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Technology stack

Using react\styled-components\jest+react-testing-lib because I'm using it across all current active projects

Not using TS in order to save some time on typings

Implemented in FP + react-hooks as for now it's the most correct way to develop apps from react-team view
